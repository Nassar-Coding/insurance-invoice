# Generated attempts

`python -m insurance_audit reproduce` writes each attempt, the current pointers
and the validated submission release into this folder. The outputs are excluded
from Git because the frozen inputs reproduce them exactly, so a fresh clone
holds only this file and fills the rest on the first run.

Nothing here is an input: no prediction, test or report reads a previous
attempt. The folder exists because `src/insurance_audit/submission.py` writes a
release here before promoting it to `submission.csv`.

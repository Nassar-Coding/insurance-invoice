A line's description is scored against the *names of the contracted services*

`quantity`, `invoice_total_cents` or any rate: a description means what it
says, and a price that disagrees with the contract is the error being looked
for, never evidence about which service was delivered.

The four states are the plan's:

- `MATCH`      best score >= MIN_SCORE and margin to the runner-up >= MIN_MARGIN
- `TIE`        best score >= MIN_SCORE but the margin is smaller
- `WEAK`       best score between NO_MATCH_FLOOR and MIN_SCORE
- `NO_MATCH`   best score below NO_MATCH_FLOOR; the description names no
               contracted service, and that is itself the error

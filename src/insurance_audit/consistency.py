"""Settle a contract ambiguity by how the parties actually performed it.

Where an agreement admits more than one reading of a pricing stage, the audit
has until now recorded every supported outcome and withheld the invoice. That
is right when the readings genuinely disagree about this hospital's billing,
and wasteful when they do not: if one reading accounts for essentially every
rate the hospital itself billed and the others account for far fewer, the
parties have shown which reading they were working to, and the handful of
lines that reading cannot account for are the errors.

This is **not** the billed price being used as evidence of which service a line
names — the matcher never sees a price, and that separation is asserted by its
own tests. It is the billed population being used to choose between readings of
a clause, which is how a course of dealing settles an ambiguous term.

A reading is adopted only when all of these hold:

- the contract text admits it (each candidate below cites the clause);
- the stage covers at least `MINIMUM_LINES` of this hospital's supported lines,
  so a handful of lines cannot settle a clause;
- it accounts for at least `MINIMUM_SHARE` of *every* relevant line, counting a
  line it leaves ambiguous as one it has not accounted for, so a reading cannot
  win the test by committing to less;
- every other admissible reading accounts for strictly less.

Otherwise the stage stays ambiguous and those invoices stay withheld. Nothing
here is fitted to labels, stored between runs, or keyed to an invoice, a record
count or an input fingerprint: the test is recomputed from whatever data is
present, so it re-decides itself on unseen invoices.
